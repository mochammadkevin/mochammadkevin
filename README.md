# Hey, I'm Kevin! ðŸ‘‹  

I'm a Product Engineer at Dicoding, currently in my final year of university.  

When Iâ€™m not deep in code, Iâ€™m probably lost in music or squeezing in a workout at home. No specific genre rules my playlistâ€”if it sounds good, Iâ€™m all in. Working out helps me reset after long hours in front of a screen, keeping both my body and mind in check.  

I love building and optimizing products, mostly with **PHP, TypeScript, JavaScript, and Vue**â€”but Iâ€™m always up for a challenge. If a different language or framework makes more sense, Iâ€™ll dive right in.
